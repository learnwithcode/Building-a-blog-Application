        "body": "With WordPress powering more than 25% of all websites in the world, there's never been a better time to build an income and a business around it.\r\n\r\nYou're here because you want to master WordPress, right? Good idea. You're in the right place. And, you can do it without learning any programming or coding.\r\n\r\nWhile WordPress is open source, and because of that has thousands of developers building resources for it, it still takes quite a bit of learning to become a master at building and managing websites with it. It's not just learning the WordPress software, there's a small amount of graphic design knowledge needed, hosting and server management, troubleshooting broken sites or problems by hacking into the back end and server setup, and properly staging development environments around new sites or when performing updates and changes on existing sites.\r\n\r\n\"What a great course! Good explanation and a lot to learn, friendly and very quick support. I'm only at the beginning and I'll leave another review later after I finished this course. I'm sure there is much more to learn!\" --Adriene\r\n\r\nWhy am I qualified to teach you?\r\n\r\nThrough this course, I'll teach you everything I've learned and mastered\r\nthrough 10 years of building, managing, migrating, and hosting WordPress websites.\r\n\r\n\"He is concise and well spoken, without dumbing it down at all. As a total newbie to Wordpress, I'm thankful he's offering this! 3 lessons in and it's great so far.\" --Jamie Rasmussen\r\n\r\nMy business lets me work on my own schedule, manage my home workspace\r\nwithout a boss or a manager, and gives me an unlimited ceiling for profit and income and time freedom.",

You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.\r\n\r\nSound familiar?\r\n\r\nI created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Node.js Developer Course 2 covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.\r\n\r\nThe entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start you\u2019ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I\u2019ve designed to reinforce what you\u2019ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you\u2019re done.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be building four projects:\r\n\r\nA note-taking app to get your feet wet\r\nA weather application that interacts with Google Maps and Dark Sky API\r\nA to-do REST API complete with user accounts and authentication\r\nA real-time chat app with a client-side companion\r\nBy the end, you\u2019ll be able to take what you\u2019ve learned and launch your own Node application.\r\n\r\nWhen learning, learn the latest.\r\n\r\nI work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with Node.js version 8, the newest Node version available.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.\r\n\r\nEverything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.\r\n\r\nYou can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no better time to learn Node.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.\r\n\r\nYou might get stuck. But I\u2019m here to help.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m in the Q&A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny questions people seem to have are answered swiftly, clearly, and often with examples posted on GitHub. Even when the questions asked are out of the scope of the course Andrew seems to come up trumps.\" - Adam Tait",

Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course: The Burger Builder!\r\n\r\nMore details please!\r\n\r\nJavaScript is the major driver of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.\r\n\r\nBut using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.\r\n\r\nReact to the rescue! \r\n\r\nReact is all about components - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.\r\n\r\nNeed to display a list of users in your app? It's as simple as creating a \"User\" component and outputting it as often as needed.\r\n\r\nThis course will start at the very basics and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way from basic to advanced. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page) applications!\r\n\r\nA detailed list with the course content can be found below.\r\n\r\nWho's teaching you in this course?\r\n\r\nMy name is Maximilian Schwarzm\u00fcller, I'm a freelance web developer and worked with React in many projects. I'm also a 5-star rated instructor here on Udemy. I cover React's most popular alternatives - Vue and Angular - as well as many other topics. I know what I'm talking about and I know where the pain points can be found.\r\n\r\nIt's my goal to get you started with React as quick as possible and ensure your success. But I don't just focus on students getting started. I want everyone to benefit from my courses, that's why we'll dive deeply into React and why I made sure to also share knowledge that's helpful to advanced React developers.",
